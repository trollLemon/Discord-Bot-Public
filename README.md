# What is this 
This is a multi role bot for Discord. It can play music in a voice channel, send random lyrics from DeathGrips songs, and basic image manipulation with links to images the user enters. 

This was origiinally a small project for my friends and I and their Discord server, but I decided to make a public version of the bot with the same features.

# Stuff you need
This bot uses pm2 to keep it running in case of an error, so you will need that.

You also need nodejs and npm to run the bot and install it's dependencies. 

# How to run the bot

First, fill in the json file *config.json* (which is located in the main folder) with your bot token, the guild id, and the client id. Next, install all the dependencies by running **npm install** in the directory you cloned the repo in.

Then, run the bash script **RUNME.SH** to get P2M running along with the bot.
